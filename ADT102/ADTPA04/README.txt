for java code:
	I don't know if it can completely run on your computer or not but the code not require any external package so I think
	the java code can run
	- don't use the command line interface to execute the program because some awt and swing package not suitable for those enviroment
	- I use "IntelliJ IDEA" for execute my code not sure about VS code or other IDE

for python
	I install matplotlib package for graphplotting so if you want to execute the python code you need to install the package first
	to install the package : pip install matplotlib
	if you don't have pip package you should also install too : https://pypi.org/project/pip/
	
	the python code also cannot execute on CLI so use the IDE instant
	- I use the "Visual studio Enterpise" for execute my code and again I don't know it other IDE will work

work with graphic is very complicated for me but I think I it time to learning computer graphic via those programming language

if you read til this line please recommend the programming language that suitable for computer graphic
