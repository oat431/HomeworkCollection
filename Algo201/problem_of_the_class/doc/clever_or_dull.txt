Explain what did Sessa do.
    Seassa is invented a game of chess and King of that kingdom do like it

Do you think Sessa is Claver or dull ? Why 
        Sessa is very clever that satisfy the king by invented the game of chess and everyone include the king love it 
    but at that time Sessa maybe smart that Bargain with the king to give him a very huge gain of wheat
    because at the time wheat can turn into a beer or something that peasant love. 
        look in our time maybe he got a bad decision, about 18 trillion gain of wheat now a day are not worthy 
    because we have a very useful thing like stock or business so to be clever Sessa need to be a partner with King's Business. 
        In my opinion, Seassa very clever in his time because he bargains 18 trillion of gain but in our time
    he is a little bit dull because now day we have something very costly than 18 trillion of gain
