Bayyapu said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should support 
efforts by countries to build public acceptance of nuclear energy and continue to help 
them start or expand nuclear energy programmes. Nuclear reactors do not produce 
greenhouse gases like power plants using coal. Therefore, they can increase electricity 
generation without contributing to climate change and provide a steady supply of electricity. 
Unlike solar and wind power sources, nuclear plants can operate when there is 
no sun or wind and are not affected by fluctuations in water availability like hydroelectric plants.
